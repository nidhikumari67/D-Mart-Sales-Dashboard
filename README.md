Power Bi Dashboard

### I worked on a project to analyze sales data for an e-commerce business, where I created annual sales reports using both Excel and Power BI. In Excel, I used pivot tables, charts, and advanced functions for data analysis and reporting. Later, I used Power BI to create interactive dashboards for more dynamic data exploration, integrating the same dataset. Both tools helped uncover insights such as customer demographics, sales trends, and top-selling products."
